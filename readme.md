# Kinds of graphs

### Meta DB
Major purpose is for data modeling in 2-d table and sync different models fields in a graph.

### Knowledge Graph
General purpose graph for knowledge base.

# Naming Convention

Rule 1: Less isolated namespaces. More globally unique names.

`xxx_id` over `id`: to avoid duplicate field names.
